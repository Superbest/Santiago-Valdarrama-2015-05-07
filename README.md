This is a collection of Python scripts which solve the 5 problems posed by Santiago Valdarrama on [his blog](https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour).

Each question is implemented as a single Python file containing a single function (except for Question 1, where three variants are requested) that returns the required result.

There is also a set of tests included for verifying the solutions - test cases are constructed based on problem statements, Santiago's examples, as well as my own intuition.
